// Haptic's reactivity engine

// Implements the push-pull reactive programming model. Uses "Boxes" to store
// data and "Reaction" functions which do work. Reactions can read boxes in a
// neutral way, called a pass-read, or, in a way that subscribes them to box
// updates, called a subscribe-read. Writing a value to a box causes it to call
// all subscribed reactions (the push), even if the value hasn't changed. Each
// time a reaction runs it reads from boxes (pull). Its subscribe-reads are
// compared to those of its previous run and unused boxes are automatically
// unsubscribed. If there are no more subscriptions after a run then the
// reaction is deleted.

// Explicit subscriptions avoid accidental reaction calls that were an issue in
// Haptic's previous "Signal" reactivity model (from Sinuous/Solid/S.js)
