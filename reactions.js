// Haptic's reactivity engine

// Implements the push-pull reactive programming model. Uses "Boxes" to store
// data and "Reaction" functions which do work. Reactions can read boxes in a
// neutral way, called a pass-read, or, in a way that subscribes them to box
// updates, called a subscribe-read. Writing a value to a box causes it to call
// all subscribed reactions (the push), even if the value hasn't changed. Each
// time a reaction runs it reads from boxes (pull). Its subscribe-reads are
// compared to those of its previous run and unused boxes are automatically
// unsubscribed. If there are no more subscriptions after a run then the
// reaction is deleted.

// Explicit subscriptions avoid accidental reaction calls that were an issue in
// Haptic's previous "Signal" reactivity model (from Sinuous/Solid/S.js)

// the sFrom() method to register its subscriptions

// TODO: Next is to implement the OK-ing of subscriptions to values that would
// otherwise be "Not allowed" since caller !== activeReaction

// Remember that reactions have consistency restrictions for pass-reading or
// subscribe-reading reactive boxes. However, this is bordered at the function
// boundary. Each function call has its own consistency checks. If you have a
// subscribe-read to s(data.count) at the top level and then use SomeFunction()
// which has no subscriptions but does a pass-read to data.count(), that's OK.
// However, if SomeFunction contained an s() then you can't simply call it;
// you'll get an error. Instead you need to decide to use either sIgnore() or
// sFrom(). Using sIgnore frees you of any consistency checks and SomeFunction
// can be thought to contain no subscriptions. If you use sFrom, then the inner
// subscriptions are moved into your scope, so the consistency checks apply.

DoSomeWork() // Error as s(data.count); OK as data.count()
