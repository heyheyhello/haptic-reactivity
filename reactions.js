// This isn't bad tho! It's actually the main way Haptic does reactivity in JSX
// via <p>Hey {() => s(data.list).join(', ')}</p>. That's snippet isn't a
// reaction itself but is called later during a DOM updating reaction that uses
// the sFrom() method to register its subscriptions

// TODO: Next is to implement the OK-ing of subscriptions to values that would
// otherwise be "Not allowed" since caller !== activeReaction

// I think, like sRead, I'll have sAllowedCallers = new Set() and then on
// runReaction if activeReaction === undefined then that's in sAllowedCallers.
// All nested reactions/functions will _not_ be in sAllowedCallers unless

// Remember that reactions have consistency restrictions for pass-reading or
// subscribe-reading a pushbox. However, this is bordered at the function
// boundary. Each function call has its own consistency checks. If you have a
// subscribe-read to s(data.count) at the top level and then use SomeFunction()
// which has no subscriptions but does a pass-read to data.count(), that's OK.
// However, if SomeFunction contained an s() then you can't simply call it;
// you'll get an error. Instead you need to decide to use either sIgnore() or
// sFrom(). Using sIgnore frees you of any consistency checks and SomeFunction
// can be thought to contain no subscriptions. If you use sFrom, then the inner
// subscriptions are moved into your scope, so the consistency checks apply.

DoSomeWork() // Error as s(data.count); OK as data.count()
sIgnore(DoSomeWork) // OK. This is helpful for console debugging etc.
sFrom(DoSomeWork) // Error since the resulting subscriptions have no reactions
createReaction(DoSomeWork) // Works as s(data.count); Useless as data.count()
